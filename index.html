        <h2>Executive Summary</h2>
        <p>
            The Aura Ecosystem (FurryWatch) is a fully integrated pet safety, health, and behavior monitoring system. 
            It unifies a smart e-collar, intelligent crate, and AI-powered camera into one ecosystem controlled by a 
            single mobile app. Designed for reliability, predictive care, and real-time remote interaction, Aura delivers 
            continuous monitoring through hybrid Wi-Fi/cellular connectivity and a single subscription model. 
            Aura solves the fragmentation and inefficiencies of current pet tech by offering a cohesive, automated, and 
            intelligent pet care platform.

    <section id="problems" class="section alt">
        <h2>Problems We Solve</h2>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Fragmented Devices:</strong> Current GPS trackers, cameras, feeders, and health monitors each require separate apps and subscriptions.</li>
            <li><strong>Poor Connectivity:</strong> Most devices rely solely on Wi-Fi and fail when the connection drops.</li>
            <li><strong>Lack of Intelligence:</strong> Existing systems rarely include AI for behavioral or health anomaly detection.</li>
            <li><strong>No Automation:</strong> Current solutions cannot take automated environmental action.</li>
            <li><strong>Limited Remote Control:</strong> Owners cannot intervene in real time when away.</li>
        </ul>

    <section id="solution" class="section">
        <h2>Our Solution</h2>
        <p>
            The Aura Ecosystem connects three smart devices—an AI camera, GPS/health monitoring e-collar, and intelligent crate—
            through a unified app with continuous data sharing. The system uses AI for predictive alerts, supports automated crate adjustments,
            enables real-time interventions, and prevents downtime with hybrid connectivity.
